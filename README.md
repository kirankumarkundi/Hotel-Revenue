About Dataset
Revenue management is more crucial than ever to run a successful and profitable hotel. With all the information that's now readily accessible and there are different ways to track and analyze it, your business has a wealth of new opportunities. Successful hoteliers continuously learn and improve their methods to stay one step ahead of their competition. Revenue management strategies are used by only a small percentage of independent hoteliers, limiting their revenue-generating potential.

In this Hotel-revenue project, I will address a few questions a hotel management team faces.

The questions are outlined below:
1) What is the hotel revenue growth per year?
2)Is there any relation between guest and their personal cars?
2) Is there any kind of trends/patterns observed in the data?
